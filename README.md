This repository contains Marco Almada's approaches to the Titanic competition on Kaggle.
As such, it is mostly intended as a learning repository for new techniques, languages, and
approaches to Machine Learning problems.

Currently, the only code available is a [Python Random Forest](python/Kaggle - Titanic.ipynb),
but more shall be added in time.
